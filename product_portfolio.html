        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
          At DiDi, I was responsible for managing the product that matches
          drivers in the transaction loop. The essence of the transaction is
          that the platform provides a trading venue and uses certain means to
          adjust the mismatch of supply and demand, thereby completing the
          order. Although DiDi involves two stakeholders, drivers and
          passengers, it is essentially demand-driven. Therefore, at this time,
          the regulation of supply (drivers) will directly affect the platform’s
          order completion volume. I facilitated drivers to meet passenger
          demand through time, space, and willingness adjustments, making it
          easier for passengers to get a ride quickly.
        </p>
        <h3>Time Adjustment</h3>
        <p>
          This refers to the traction of drivers in the driving time period to
          solve the mismatch of supply and demand. For example, encourage
          drivers to take more orders during the morning and evening peak hours
          at the same location. In this traction method, I mainly participated
          in the iteration of a new transaction mode on the driver side, named
          semi-assignment of ordinary orders under the along-my-way mode.
        </p>
        <h3>Along-My-Way Mode</h3>
        <p>
          The along-may-way function is an important function on the driver
          side. When the driver goes out for errands or goes home, he can only
          listen to the along-my-way orders when he turns on this function.
          Drivers who turn on this function during peak hours account for about
          11% of the overall capacity, but in fact, this function shields
          drivers from non-along-my-way orders, which is a loss of peak capacity
          for the overall market; secondly, many drivers are facing the
          situation of not being able to hear orders under the along-my-way
          mode, which will affect the driver’s order listening experience and
          income.
        </p>
        <h3>Solution: Semi-Assignment of Ordinaty Orders</h3>
        <p>
          Therefore, our solution is to use the drivers who turn on the
          along-my-way mode as temporary supplementary capacity during peak
          hours to alleviate the problem of time mismatch during peak hours and
          improve the driver’s order listening experience. In terms of strategy,
          for the MVP version, we first collect high-value orders that are
          unlikely to be answered by the passenger side in a short time and
          gather them into the order pool; secondly, the algorithm team will
          distinguish whether the driver is the first order in a period of time
          and set different order broadcasting times for the driver. When the
          driver waits for the order in place for a long time, we will
          distribute the ordinary orders in the order pool to the driver in the
          form of a semi-assignment card, and explain that this order is not
          along the way, and the driver can choose to take it or not. After the
          driver completes the order, the along-my-way mode will be
          automatically restored and listen to the along-my-way order.

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          This product solution had a phase of experimental results when I left,
          and the actual results brought about 0.3-0.4% of the overall GMV
          growth to the platform.

        <h2>DiDi: Spatial Regulation for Driver Dispatch</h2>
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
          Spatial regulation refers to the process of managing supply-demand
          mismatches by directing drivers to areas with high demand, such as
          commercial districts and office buildings.
        </p>
        <h3>Role and Responsibility</h3>
        <p>
          As the Product Manager in this project, I was involved in optimizing
          the core dispatch function on the driver’s side. Our team, consisting
          of 30 members from strategy, engineering, and operations, held weekly
          meetings to identify and redefine problems.
        </p>
        <h3>Phase 1: Understanding the Potential of Dispatch</h3>
        <p>
          In the initial phase, we wanted to understand the upper limit of the
          benefits of dispatch as a tool. Our algorithm team calculated the
          transaction rate and the proportion of orders for cities nationwide.
          According to their results, I found that when the driver’s acceptance
          rate for dispatch reached a minimum of 50%, some cities had the
          potential to achieve a 100% response rate. However, the current
          average dispatch acceptance rate was only around 30%, indicating a gap
          that needed to be addressed.
        </p>
        <h3>Experiment Design</h3>
        <p>
          To explore this, I designed an experiment to increase the dispatch
          acceptance rate by offering higher subsidies to drivers. The aim was
          to understand the potential benefits of dispatch and to identify the
          direction of optimization for the dispatch project.
        </p>
        <h3>Phase 2: Problem Identification and Solution</h3>
        <p>
          The experiment did not yield the expected results, with no significant
          increase in GMV for the platform. Not only our exploratory experiment,
          but also the dispatch project itself did not yield satisfactory
          results recently.
        </p>
        <p>
          Upon identifying this issue, I collaborated with the team to dissect
          the problem. We first worked with the algorithm team to roll back the
          strategy to a stage where there was a significant GMV benefit. We then
          analyzed the historical benefit scenarios, which were mainly during
          the periods before and after peak hours in the morning and evening,
          and at night, rather than during the peak hours themselves as we had
          assumed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Based on these findings, we redefined the effective use scenarios for
          dispatch as a supply-demand regulation tool. We also started
          monitoring every funnel link in the dispatch process, and plan to
          carry out more detailed optimization in the future.
        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          We estimate that the dispatch project can bring a 0.5% GMV benefit to
          the platform annually.

        <h2>Lizhi: Intimacy Value Feature</h2>
        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p>
          During my time at Lizhi, I was responsible for the PP Yuewan project.
          PP Yuewan held a significant position within the Lizhi Group, serving
          as a major source of revenue. As the sole revenue product manager for
          PP Yuewan, I bore a significant responsibility.
        </p>
        <h3>Problem Identification</h3>
        <p>
          Before I joined PP Yuewan, the app, being an online voice chat room
          software, had a rather shady monetization strategy. The top 5% of
          players accounted for 98% of the consumption on the software, which
          was primarily spent on probability gameplay, essentially a form of
          disguised online gambling. This posed several problems. Firstly, with
          tightening policies, gaining revenue through this method was
          unsustainable. If compliance issues arose one day, removing the
          probability gameplay could cause a significant shakeup in revenue.
          Secondly, the value proposition for users was unclear. If users were
          playing these games instead of using the chat room functions, it
          indicated that the product’s value proposition was not well
          communicated.
        </p>
        <h3>Strategy Transformation</h3>
        <p>
          Given this background, as the revenue product manager, my task was to
          transform the monetization strategy from online gambling to something
          that aligns with the product’s mission and can bring sustainable
          revenue growth to the company.
        </p>
        <h3>Data Analysis and User Research</h3>
        <p>
          I started by analyzing data and conducting user research. I found that
          the 7-day retention rate and the 7-day revenue data were important
          indicators of long-term user retention. Moreover, if we could recoup
          the revenue within 7 days, the marketing side would have more budget
          to acquire new users. This insight guided my approach to transforming
          the monetization strategy of PP Yuewan.
        </p>
        <h3>Product Design</h3>
        <p>
          Despite being a relationship-oriented entertainment platform, there
          was no place on our platform where this relationship could be visually
          represented. Therefore, I designed the “Intimacy Value” feature. On
          the surface, it is a growth system for the intimate relationship
          between the companion and the user. In reality, it provides a tool for
          visualizing relationships on the platform, allowing both parties to
          see the progress of their relationship, thereby motivating them to
          continue their long-term exchange and companionship.
        </p>
        <p>
          In this relationship, the concept of “gifts” can concretize the
          relationship. From an anthropological perspective, gifts are tokens of
          exchange. On one hand, players express their approval of the
          companion’s service by giving gifts. On the other hand, receiving
          gifts motivates companions to provide better services to players.
        </p>
        <h3>Stakeholder Alignment and Feature Development</h3>
        <p>
          After finalizing this product plan, I aligned with my stakeholders.
          Subsequently, I designed a detailed mechanism for the “Intimacy Value”
          feature, including the trigger system, accumulation conditions, tiered
          levels, and rewards for intimacy values. After designing the complete
          process for the Intimacy Value mechanism, I collaborated with
          colleagues from different departments, such as software engineers, UX
          designers, and marketing, among other stakeholders, and entered the
          product development cycle. I managed the entire product development
          process.
        </p>
        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>
          The product feature release enhanced new users' 7-day revenue by
          34.08% and boosted user retention rate by 57.33%.
